# UI Components Folder

This folder contains pure UI components that represent the design system of the application. These components are completely reusable and do not have any business logic.

## Why UI Components Folder?

Having a separate UI Components folder allows for easier organization and management of UI-related files. It also helps to keep the application structure clean and modular, making it easier to maintain and scale in the future. 

Separating UI components from other components and code related to business logic also enables easy reuse across different parts of the application, as well as in other projects if necessary.

Also, thinking about application growth, it would be easy to create a specific project for the design system and share it with other applications.
